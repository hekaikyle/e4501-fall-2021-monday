# Git and GitHub

We'll use this repository as a way to learn a typical GitHub workflow for
making a change:

  * you'll *fork* this repository to give yourself your own copy of it,
    entirely controlled by you

  * you'll make a branch within your forked repository, make the change
    within it, and push that change back to your own fork within GitHub

  * you'll send a *pull request* proposing your change back in this repo
    itself, which will be merged back
